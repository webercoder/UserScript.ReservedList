# Installation Instructions

## Chrome
The reservedlist.user.js UserScript can be included directly in chrome by dragging `reservedlist.user.js` to the extensions page. Dev mode may need to be enabled. https://stackoverflow.com/a/13672143

## Firefox
Firefox requires an extension to use the UserScript natively without the TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey extensions. Do that by including this directory when following these directions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#Installing
